<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Muzammil Khan!</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Passionate MERN Stack Developer and Machine Learning Enthusiast</h3>

:wave: About Me
I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I love bringing ideas to life through code, from the initial design to the final deployment. My journey in technology has also led me to explore the fascinating world of machine learning, where I enjoy building models and finding new ways to apply data science principles.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack e-commerce platform with real-time features.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning and building with Next.js, TypeScript, and Python.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to React, Node.js, or machine learning.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of video games and sci-fi movies.
